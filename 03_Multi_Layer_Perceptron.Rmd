# Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP)
```{python 2_0, include=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot
np.random.seed(0)
```
Multiple layers of neurons make up a multilayer Perceptron. As a result, we must calculate the forward pass several times, as well as the backward pass. First and foremost, do we need to broaden some definitions in order to support this behavior? The NN of the following image is what we want to do:   
![https://app.diagrams.net/](./img/NN_03_new.png){ width=100% }<br>  

It's my own definition of layers since I believed it would be easier to transition from $n$ to $n+1$ hidden layers if they were displayed as indicated in the image. By evaluating $f(IN^{layer} \cdot W^{layer}) = OUT^{layer}$ and just transferring the result to the next layer like $OUT^{layer} = IN^{layer+1}$, with $f$ as the chosen activation function, you can see that each layer has the identical procedure in the forward pass.
We'll choose the sigmoid function as the activation function $f$ because it has a simple deviation $f'$ which is used for the backward pass and behaves similarly to the heavyside function with an output between 0 and 1.

```{python 2_1}
def sigmoid(x):
  return 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-x))

def deriv_sigmoid(x):
  return x * (1 - x)
```

Additionaly will we choose the XOR-Gate as training dataset and generate random weights in a very generic approach:
```{python 2_2}
X = np.array([
  [0,0],
  [0,1],
  [1,0],
  [1,1],
]) 

Y = np.array([
  [0],
  [1],
  [1],
  [0]
])

n_input = len(X[0])
n_output = len(Y[0])
hidden_layer_neurons = [2] # the 2 means that there is one hidden layer with 2 neurons

def generate_weights(n_input, n_output, hidden_layer_neurons):
  W = []
  for i in range(len(hidden_layer_neurons)+1):
    if i == 0: # first layer
      W.append(np.random.random((n_input+1, hidden_layer_neurons[i])))
    elif i == len(hidden_layer_neurons): # last layer
      W.append(np.random.random((hidden_layer_neurons[i-1]+1, n_output)))
    else: # middle layers
      W.append(np.random.random((hidden_layer_neurons[i-1]+1, hidden_layer_neurons[i])))
   
  return(W)

W = generate_weights(n_input, n_output, hidden_layer_neurons)

print("W[0]: \n", W[0])
print("W[1]: \n", W[1])
```

The neurons for the hidden layers are generated using the `hidden_layer_neurons` list, while the input and output layer neurons are calculated from the training dataset. `hidden_layer_neurons = [4,2]`, for example, can construct two hidden layers with 4 and 2 neurons. I didn't choose the bias because it is automatically rectified.
Is it now necessary to construct a helper function to add the biases to the last column of the inputs, like follows:
```{python 2_3}
def add_ones_to_input(x):
  return(np.append(x, np.array([np.ones(len(x))]).T, axis=1))
```


## Forward pass
The structur of the new forward function looks exactly like in the single Perceptron:
```{python 2_4}
def forward(x, w):
  return( sigmoid(x @ w) )
```

Now we have everything to calculate the forward pass of the NN from above with the generated weights step by step:
```{python 2_5}
IN = []
OUT = []

# layer 0
i = 0
IN.append( add_ones_to_input(X) )
OUT.append( forward(IN[i], W[i]) )

# layer 1
i = 1
IN.append( add_ones_to_input(OUT[i-1]) )
OUT.append( forward(IN[i], W[i]) )

# error
Y-OUT[-1]
```
Thats all! We calculated the forward pass in a very generic way for the NN with 2 input neurons, 2 hidden neurons and 1 output neuron for all 4 scenarios at the same time. Sadly is the forward pass the easiest part of the multilayer Perceptron :)  

## Backward pass
The weights will be adjusted using the backpropagation algorithm, which is a variant of the descent gradient algorithm. Calculating the sensitives of the outputs according to the activation function multiplied by the error that occurred is done in the output layer. On all other layers, it's calculated by reversing the previously calculated gradient, splitting it up on each neuron by the previews weights, and multiplying the sensitivity of that layer's outputs by the activation function's sensitivity. The following is the formula:
$$
  grad^i= 
\begin{cases}
    f^`(OUT^i) \cdot (Y-OUT^i),& i =\text{last layer}\\
    f^`(OUT^i) \cdot (grad^{i+1} * \widetilde{W}^{i+1\ T}),& \text{else}
\end{cases}
$$
with $\widetilde{W}$ as the weights of the layer $i$, without the connection to the bias neuron. You can calculate $\widetilde{W}$ in our datastructure by removing the last row.  
The gradients for the backward pass are calculated using the following code:
```{python 2_6}
grad = [None] * 2

# layer 1
i = 1
grad[i] = deriv_sigmoid(OUT[i]) * (Y-OUT[i])

# layer 0
i = 0
grad[i] = deriv_sigmoid(OUT[i]) *(grad[i+1] @ W[i+1][0:len(W[i+1])-1].T) # without bias weights
```


You can now examine the gradient of the last layer and the direction in which it is displayed:
```{python 2_7}
print("Y: \n",Y)
print("OUT: \n",OUT[1])
print("grad: \n",grad[1])
```
The gradient appears to be pointing in the direction of drifting the output $OUT$ closer to the desired output $Y$. The gradient descent algorithm accomplishes exactly that.
The weights with the gradients and the learningrate $\alpha$ must then be adjusted according to the direction of the gradients using the following formula:
$$
  W^i_{new} = W^i_{old} + \alpha \cdot ( IN^{i\ T} * grad^i) 
$$
After the first epoch, we get the following results for the adjusted weights in the example above:
```{python 2_8}
alpha = 0.03

W[1] = W[1] + alpha * (IN[1].T @ grad[1]) 
W[0] = W[0] + alpha * (IN[0].T @ grad[0]) 
```
This was the forward and backward pass process in a multilayer Perceptron with two input neurons, two hidden layer neurons, and one output neuron for one epoch. It's simple to use the above code to make a more generic NN with a variable number of hidden layers and variable training datasets for a given number of epochs, as shown in the appendix below.
